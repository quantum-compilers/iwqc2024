<i>Catalyst: An AOT/JIT compiler for accelerated quantum computing in Python</i>
</div>

<p>
  Software development packages for quantum computing have
  significantly evolved in recent years, having matured from early
  prototypes to tools and products for research, development, and
  education. Yet, many are still limited by early designs for
  constructing and representing quantum programs, which struggle to
  provide performance for large-scale applications and hybrid
  quantum-classical compute workflows.
</p>

<p>
Catalyst is a new just-in-time (JIT) and ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler
for accelerated quantum computing in Python. It introduces a unified
intermediate representation (IR) for hybrid programs based on the MLIR
compiler framework; a frontend that enables the capture of hybrid
compute graphs from Python, with integration into the PennyLane SDK
and the Python machine learning ecosystem; and a runtime library for
hybrid workflow execution on heterogeneous computing resources. A key
focus is the support for advanced quantum programming paradigms, such
as real-time measurement feedback, (unbounded) control flow, and
quantum differentiable programming with simulator- and
hardware-compatible automatic differentiation (AD).
