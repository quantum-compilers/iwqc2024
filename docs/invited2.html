      <i>Quantum Compilation: crossing the NISQ era.</i>
</div>

<p>The advances in quantum hardware with functional quantum processors
integrating tens of noisy qubits, together with the availability of
near-term quantum algorithms have allowed the development of the
so-called full-stacks that bridge quantum applications with quantum
devices. A central layer of this stack is the quantum compiler that
not only translates high-level code into low-level instructions that
are executable on the quantum processor, but more importantly performs
a series of transformations to the quantum circuit to meet the quantum
hardware constraints and deal with its impairments. In this talk,
after providing an overview of the different layers of the quantum
computing full-stack, we will focus on the quantum compilation
process. We will then discuss the need for optimal physical-aware and
algorithm-driven compilation techniques in the midst of the NISQ
(Noisy Intermediate-scale quantum) era. Finally, we will talk about
scalable quantum computing systems based on multi-core architectures
and the compilation requirements to perform distributed quantum
computing.
